# Development Process

When reading over the assignment, the first thought that came to mind was building out the blog page in my coffee shop website more so that it is fully functional. Originally, when a user would click the "Blog" navigational button, they would be directed to 4 blog cards with quick summaries and descriptive titles on what each blog would speak about. A "Read more" hyper link was present on each blog card, but none were functional which, in hindsight, gave me so much room to improve my site.

When in the building phase using Claude Web, I made sure to explain that I wanted author names to be present, along with a users ability to interact with blog posts through liking, commenting, and sharing via copy and paste and social media.

The first, smaller addition of adding dates and author names to the blog cards was very important in the making of a made-up community surrounding this coffee shop website. While the creation of the 4 blog pages was pivotal in the building stage, routing those pages to the "Read more" hyperlinks made the website feel more complete and well rounded, along with the loading states to mock how a backend could elevate the content.

Lastly, the addition of more blogs like the one a user just read at the bottom of a post encourages the user to explore more posts in a natural flow without having to constantly go back to the blog card page and click into another one.

The liking and commenting features also save on a board that other users are able to scroll through. One feature I would later add would be the ability to reply to comments and like comments to really push conversations on the platform.
